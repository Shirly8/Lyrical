Honey Boy

[Chorus]
Honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

Honey Boy
You think you cute, you such a tease
I see you lying through your teeth

Honey Boy
I'm way too fragile to be played off (played off)
And in denial to think I'm wrong (so wrong)

Honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

[Verse]
I've seen you through your highs and lows
You come and go
You hate the jokes
Yet you started most
You have no goals
But you hold onto one hope

But I don't know what it could've been
If we haven't changed
Our promises
Could be endless bliss
But your ignorance
Led us crash and burn that bridge

[Chorus]
So honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

[Verse]
I wish upon a star
That your ass won't go too far
You'll mess up again
Can we play pretend
That you'll fall into my arms

I wish upon the moon
That one day you'll there soon
You'll get drunk again
Spilling secrets then
And loving me was one of them

[Chorus]
So honey boy
Quit your fucking act for me
Your only chance to come out clean
Come out clean
Come out clean

[Outro]
Theodore
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me
