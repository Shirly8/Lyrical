Can you:
[Verse]
Give a paradise
Where the sun comes up to change your life
And the wind storms up to change your life
Okay

Give me the perfect skies
Cause the visual right now blurs my eyes
There's no waves to hear than the gloomy cries
Alright

[Chorus]
Give me one last hope
To tell me I'm one of them beautiful souls
I need fantasy that I can control
I need one more reason to let this go
 Give me something to cope
Cause this life right is a tight rope
I got this feeling I'm down a slippery
Can you be that person that I can keep close
 Can you give me it?
Can you fix this guilt?
Can you give me it?
Can you?

[Verse]
Can you take off my mask
Where the presence so strong, I don't think bout the past
Where I'm free of my space, I'll think react
Okay
 Can you be like friend
Where I'll never stop thinking that the world wouldn't end
Where the moon won't stop but the stars start to land
Alright…

[Chorus]
Give me one last hope
To tell me I'm one of them beautiful souls
I need fantasy that I can control
I need one more reason to let this go
 Give me something to cope
Cause this life right is a tight rope
I got this feeling I'm down a slippery
Can you be that person that I can keep close
 Can you give me it?
Can you fix this guilt?
Can you give me it?
Can you?
