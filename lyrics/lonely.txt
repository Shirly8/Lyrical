Lonely:

[Chorus]
When you're lonely by yourself
When you're feeling like you're a little stranded
And there's no one to call help
So your heart is only left damaged

When you're lonely in your cell
All you needed was a little guidance
He won't give you love you felt
Kicked you out of the apartment

[Verse]
He said that he would support then
When the moment shows up,
He won't show your important
He's too busy with himself
Think your problems are worthless
When you're finally doing well,
You'll get hit with the bullet

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you fell
It all seems clear
You're stuck in hell
That's why you fear

[Chorus]
When you're lonely by yourself
When you're feeling like you're a little stranded
And there's no one to call help
So your heart is only left damaged

When you're lonely in your cell
All you needed was a little guidance
He won't give you love you felt
Kicked you out of the apartment

[Verse]
He kicked you out of the apartment
Wouldn't give you back your things
Locked it in the compartment
Said for you to get some pills
And come back a new person
Said he'll love you very well
If you don't have depression

Told me I was important
I'm a blessing and a curse
But today I'm a curse
Everybody seems so close
But nobody would listen
They all tryna be your friend
When the time comes
They selfish

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you fell
It all seems clear
You're stuck in hell
That's why you fear

[Chorus]
When you're lonely by yourself
When you're feeling like you're a little stranded
And there's no one to call help
So your heart is only left damaged
When you're lonely in your cell
All you needed was a little guidance
He won't give you love you felt
Kicked you out of the apartment

[Bridge]
Break down over when the time's up
Your eyes covered in makeup
You drink a lot of liquor
To feel a little better
So smile for the picture
And hold on a little longer
That moment you consider
If you should pull the trigger.
