Hands Low:

[Chorus]
Hands low
Keep it around my waist
And don't you let go
Your face so close to my neck
But you breathe slow
We could fuck for hours
Don't you let go

Please don't
Don't you leave me here cuz I'll ride solo
You lean against me, say that we should go home
We could fuck for hours
Don't you let go

[Verse]
I promise I'm not drunk
I sobered up
I know what's up
So fill my cup with two more shots
What's this reminded of?

I see the room is spinning
Heartbeat's racing
Need your help
But underneath the darkness
Close the curtains
Feel my touch

If you hold me down maybe I won't move
I surrender all right now [I'm surrending right now]
And if I need your love, show me what it cost
I'll buy it in a rush

[Chorus]
Hands low
Keep it around my waist
And don't you let go
Your face so close to my neck
But you breathe slow
We could fuck for hours
Don't you let go

Please don't
Don't you leave me here cuz I'll ride solo
You lean against me, say that we should go home
We could fuck for hours
Don't you let go

[Bridge]
Baby, what you tryna say
What'd you mean it's late?
I just want you here forever

If you're tryna sell me pills
Tell me if it fills
The void that it's been getting bigger

[Outro]
Please go
I just fucking met you, why'd you lean close
Don't you dare come near me, leave me alone
We could've fucked for hours
But it won't heal souls.
