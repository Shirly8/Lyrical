Not coming Home:

[Chorus]
Sweetie, Daddy's not coming home
I gotta let you know
This taught us to be so strong

I'm sorry
He ain't coming back soon
This leaves just me and you
I promise we'd make it through

[Verse]
He promise he'd get us milk
Packed his suitcase, his jacket, and all his guilt
When in fact it was arguments we had dealt
But attacked, we was arguing how we felt

He took all the liquors and cash
Shook he didn't take picture of all of your pasts
It's been two weeks since Victor ain't coming back
Wasted two sleeps to lecture about your scraps

[Chorus]
Sweetie, Daddy's not coming home (Daddy's not coming home)
I gotta let you know
This taught us to be so strong

I'm sorry
He ain't coming back soon (He ain't coming back soon)
This leaves just me and you
I promise we'd make it through

[Verse]
It still hurts me
I still think about him with other women
I still think he'd have more children
Then abandon them feeling neglected

And I'm so sorry
You used to play Barbie with that man
Now it harms me you have no Ken
And he can hardly see you ten

[Chorus]
Sweetie, Daddy's not coming home (Daddy's not coming home)
I gotta let you know
This taught us to be so strong

I'm sorry
He ain't coming back soon (He ain't coming back soon)
This leaves just me and you
I promise we'd make it through
