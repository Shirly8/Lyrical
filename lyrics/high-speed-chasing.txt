High Speed Chasing:

[Chorus]
High-speed chasing
Thought it was just you and me
Now you're just an enemy

My life was stolen
Everything you stole from me
Caught up by your jealousy

[Verse]
Mama, I just killed a friend
I knocked her dead thinking one day she'd wake up again
And now I know I'm the one who lost my innocence
Sometimes I wonder why we must compete

Mama, I just killed a friend
I left a crime with my bloody handprints on her pants
And all I want is to see her spirits live again
Sometimes I think she plans it secretly

[Chorus]
High-speed chasing
Thought it was just you and me
Now you're just an enemy

You kept our promise
A promise you said we'd keep
Caught up your jealousy

[Verse]
Papa, I betrayed a friend
She broke my trust, he's the one that left us in this mess
Cuz all she wanted was to take away what I possess
Sometimes she prays on insecurities

Papa, I betrayed my man
He did it first but I also got bit envious
I didn't know that revenge would this dangerous
Sometimes I wonder why weren't happy

[Chorus]
High-speed chasing
Thought it was just you and me
Now you're just an enemy

My life was stolen
Everything you stole from me
Caught up by your jealousy

[Bridge]
Evil
Thought you was my friend
But your ego
Got caught up in this game
You're not able
To see what I can hide
I'm like John Doe
Looking at your shadow
You're a piece of me
You should've seen it coming
When you messed with me
You should've seen a psycho without therapy
But your heart felt so hallow
With a knife that deep
So

[Chorus]
High-speed chasing
Thought it was just you and me
Now you're just an enemy

My life was stolen
Everything you stole from me
Caught up by your jealousy
