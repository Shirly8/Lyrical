[Verse]
What have I done
Deserved something more
What I have become
I heard from my mum
You live or you die
There's nothing inside
I can't live in a life

[Chorus]
I told you I can't accept this boring life
I told you I needed to do something right
I'm leaving my mark
Fore I leave this earth
I'm selling my soul so I'd be like them stars

I told you I can't live like everyone
I told you I've got to be like one of em
I'm leaving my mark
Fore I leave this earth
I hope you'll see my face and my name in the stars

[Verse]
What could I've done
I killed off my past
I'll never go back
I needed the fame
My only escape
Now I am ashamed
But they're dead it's too late

[Chorus]
I told you I can't accept this boring life
I told you I needed to do something right
I'm leaving my mark
Fore I leave this earth
I'm selling my soul so I'd be like them stars

I told you I can't live like everyone
I told you I've got to be like one of em
I'm leaving my mark
Fore I leave this earth
I hope you'll see my face and my name in the stars

[Bridge]
Convinced my myself I am a symbol
A saint and a national treasure
Sensational glamorous lead now
I'll never go back to my hometown

[Outro]
I'm leaving my mark
Fore I leave this earth
I hope you'll see my face and my name in the stars
