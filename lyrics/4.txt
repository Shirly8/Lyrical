Stargazing:

[Verse]
I see the starlight outside
It brightens up the whole night
It seems like nothing
But felt like something

Reminds me of your blue eyes
Get lost in just the plain sight
I stare there gazing
It feels amazing

[Chorus]
And all I want
Is to live reality
Find a place
So there's hope for you and me
A perfect sky
Filled with possibility
The stars above
Counting to infinity

I'm stargazing
Isn't it amazing
Keeps my heart racing
With you that's the best thing

[Verse]
The stars that's on the outside
Reminds of the past times
The faster it passed by
It takes me to age nine

Nothing has changed much aside
Except we're older each night
I'm scared for my future
But you make it better

[Chorus]
And all I want
Is to live reality
Find a place
So there's hope for you and me
A perfect sky
Filled with possibility
The stars above
Counting to infinity

I'm stargazing
Isn't it amazing
Keeps my heart racing
With you that's the best thing

[Bridge]
There's one star that shines in the outskirts of my eyes
Reminds me of me so I feel I'm alright
The faster the time all the memories go by
Whenever I go, I look up and it's right there
I'll think about you and I stop feeling so scared
I see lots of hope in the one star I do stare

[Chorus]
And all I want
Is to live reality
Find a place
So there's hope for you and me
A perfect sky
Filled with possibility
The stars above
Counting to infinity

I'm stargazing
Isn't it amazing
Keeps my heart racing
With you that's the best thing
