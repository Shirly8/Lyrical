[Chorus]
Baby, I will not wake up someday
I'm doing things that will kill me once again
I'm doing shit just to take the pain away
And I don't want you there when I fade away
I piss you off, make you angry so you wouldn't stay
Cuz I don't want to see you hurt that way
It's not your fault for my fall, so please don't blame yourself when I'm gone

[Verse]
I'm sorry I'm selfish
But maybe you're a little too selfless
You should've left at the second I got reckless
It should've ended when I picked up my bad habits

You almost wanted to be over last Christmas,
'Cause I was stubborn when I was sober around your parents.
When I broke their trust, I just lost control,
You ended up choosing us when you took me home.

[Pre-Chorus]
You loved me
More than I could love myself
Would've ended it a lot early
If you weren't there to help

Cuz now I feel like I'm a bit of a burden
Causing trouble for the two of us
So I'll make sure that you're happy in the moment
Happier with someone else

[Chorus]
Baby, I will not wake up someday
I'm doing things that will kill me once again
I'm doing shit just to take the pain away
And I don't want you there when I fade away
I piss you off, make you angry so you wouldn't stay
Cuz I don't want to see you hurt that way
It's not your fault for my fall, so please don't blame yourself when I'm gone


[Bridge]
The last time I overdosed
Kept myself alive for as long as I could cope
Because seeing you with me was my only hope
But now I'm walking on a thin loose rope.

So the next time I overdose
I'll get high with a grin, knowing I won't be holding on,
I'd better die with the hint that you're not alone
And you'll wonder where I've been, but that pain won't last long.



[Chorus]
Baby, I will not wake up someday
I'm doing things that will kill me once again
I'm doing shit just to take the pain away
And I don't want you there when I fade away
I piss you off, make you angry so you wouldn't stay
Cuz I don't want to see you hurt that way
It's not your fault for my fall, so please don't blame yourself when I'm gone
