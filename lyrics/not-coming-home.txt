Last Words:

[Verse]
With my wrist tied on
It's approaching dawn
As my soul awaits its fate

They got the switches on
And their grip so strong
In the midst of death's embrace

Well I just played along
And I said I'm wrong
I knew it was too late

Becuase I shot someone
Was a hit and run
Didn't know that it was him

[Chorus]
That's what they know
That's what I show
I took the blame
Concealed his name.
My love affair
Take to the grave
What's worse than death
Is that I betrayed

[Verse]
At 2:00
They heard a call
That a man's shot in the head
In a similar spot
There's a different sock
Hanging so close to his bed
But his doors unlocked
And I was in his lot
They think I come here for revenge
But it wasn't me
It was somebody
Who had left that man to bleed

[Chorus]
They'll never know
I'll never show
I loved him so
I let him go
My love affair
Take to the grave
What's worse than death is that I betrayed

[Bridge]
You said that you won't be home
You said that you're at work for long
You said nothing is going on
When I saw her lips on yours

I thought that since you did it first
I thought that it would be my turn
But now you won't return
I'll come to see you when I burn
Burn
When I burn

[Outro]
With my wrist tied on
It's approaching dawn
As my soul awaits its fate
