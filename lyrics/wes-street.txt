Wes street:

[Chorus]
I'll be down the wes street
When you need me, you'll come find me
When the sunsets
I'll be sipping slushy
Feel the city
Cuz the night skies
Filled with beauty

Say what you want what you feel
Sobbing so loud no one's here
Let go of all of your tears
You know I will always be here

[Verse]
We're old and youthful waiting til our life goes
You'll deal with trouble just follow where the wind blows
I'll be the friend that you always can rely on
I'll show you purpose, that this the life that you want

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moon is gone
I lose all that I've longed for
But every once in a while
If you someone to hold on

[Chorus]
I'll be down the wes street
When you need me, you'll come find me
When the sunsets
I'll be sipping slushy
Feel the city
Cuz the night skies
Filled with beauty

Say what you want what you feel
Sobbing so loud no one's here
Let go of all of your tears
You know I will always be here

[Bridge]
Tell me your struggles and doubt
Let me take you on a route
Stay far away from the crowd
You're the only one I've ever loved

[Chorus]
I'll be down the wes street
When you need me, you'll come find me
When the sunsets
I'll be sipping slushy
Feel the city
Cuz the night skies
Filled with beauty
