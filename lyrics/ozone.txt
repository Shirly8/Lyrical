Ozone:

[Intro]
Really?
Je ne comprends pas
En fait, je ne sais pas pourquoi tu me fais comme ça, je crois
Je mérite mieux que toi, tu sais
Mais n'importe ce que tu fais, je te veux
Et je me ne comprend pas, vraiment pas
Pourquoi je fais ça?
Pourquoi tu te fais ça?
Franchement, je ne sais pas, je sais plu
Ça doit arrêter, arrêter tout de suite

[Verse]
I'm feeling numb off of all of these Xans, yeah
I know it's time that I fucked up your plans
I wish I was more of a man
I wish I was more of a man
Oh, no, you don't understand
I neglected you again

[Pre-Chorus]
She said, "Don't forget you owe me one"
Ninety-nine cent dreams, maybe you could show me some
She told me she loved me, but I do not deserve your love
I put me above you and honestly I think I fucked it up
I don't know why

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober, no
I don't think I'll ever get sober

[Verse]
I think about you a lot
I'm doing too much but it's not enough
I wish you'd get out of your bed yeah

I wish you would do as I said
Oh no instead you're choosing to drown in alcohol again

I said, "don't forget you own me one"
You promise to show who you were, maybe you can show me some

I told you "I love you" but you do not deserve my love
I'm getting too cold around here so let me in your house
I don't know why

[Chorus]
Why do you ruin ruin the Ozone
Why am I sitting alone
You made mistakes with these white lines
And you're clouded by all of the smoke
I know that you'll never be sober
And I don't want this to be over

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober
I don't think I'll ever get sober

I'm 'bout to ruin the Ozone
I know you're sitting alone
I made mistakes with these white lines
And I'm clouded by all of the smoke
I don't think I'll ever get sober
I don't think I'll ever get sober
Oh, no, no

I said, "don't forget you own me one"
You promise to show who you were, maybe you can show me some

I told you "I love you" but you do not deserve my love
I'm getting too cold around here so let me in your house
I don't know why

[Outro]
I'm feeling numb off of all of these Xans
I know it's time that I fucked up your plans
I wish I was more of a man
I wish I was more of a man
Oh, no, you don't understand
I neglected you again
