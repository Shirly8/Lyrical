Cool Girls:

[Chorus]
Maybe there's no cool girls for you
I will take my chance with you
Maybe there's no cool girls too choose
I am worth a try for you

When the night falls
I'll be the only one to have my mask off
I'll show you what I'm like without your eyes closed
I'm not the perfect type but still won't back off
I'm cool girl

[Verse]
I heard that cool girls sleep with their makeup on
I head they like football games and take 30 shots.
I hear they swallow 3 slices and still look hot
I hear they ix cars looking like a Megan Fox alright
But were they really real
Or were they just fantasy

[Chorus]
Maybe there's no cool girls for you
I will take my chance with you
Maybe there's no cool girls too choose
I am worth a try for you

[Verse]
I know I'm not that skinny
Your standards too high for me
You watch too many movies
Picture cool girls in your sweet dreams (Picture cool girls in your sweet dreams)
I'm so sorry they're just fantasy (I'm so sorry they're not what you see)

[Chorus]
Maybe there's no cool girls for you
I will take my chance with you
Maybe there's no cool girls too choose
I am worth a try for you

When the night falls
I'll be the only one to have my mask off
I'll show you what I'm like without your eyes closed
I'm not the perfect type but still won't back off
I'm cool girl
