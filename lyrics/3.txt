Night Shift:

[Chorus]
Night Shift
You turn off all the lights
Make me speechless
I've got nothing to hide
Know I'm righteous
I'm working every night
Leave the daytime all behind
Working night shift

[Verse]
Alone by myself
Alone and so quiet
Do what I want
But get super stranded

People coming by, there's dangers in city
Maybe what I like is strangers to meet me
Its like getting high, the nature of big streets
Different in the night, come and be set free

[Chorus]
Night Shift
You turn off all the lights
Make me speechless
I've got nothing to hide
Know I'm righteous
I'm working every night
Leave the daytime all behind
Working night shift

[Verse]
Boy you know you go crazy when it's quiet
I don't mind cause I still paid with no client
They be tired but you know I'm acting like I'm speechless
Counting up the hours like I'm counting up the weekend
No way getting fired when the city sounds asleep and
Don't you feel inspire and nobody sees us breaking the rules

[Chorus]
Night Shift
You turn off all the lights
Make me speechless
I've got nothing to hide
Know I'm righteous
I'm working every night
Leave the daytime all behind
Working night shift

[Bridge]
Come join me
It's scary when no one's there
Even worst when I don't care
Working night shift
The night's free
We can meet them anywhere
As long as manager's not there
Working night shift

[Chorus]
Night Shift
You turn off all the lights
Make me speechless
I've got nothing to hide
Know I'm righteous
I'm working every night
Leave the daytime all behind
Working night shift
