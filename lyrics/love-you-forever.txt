Love you forever:

[Verse]
I went too far I wound your scars
You gave me too many chance
And I pushed too hard

If you cant forgive
Then I'll have to live
With a crime that I committed
Yeah I felt that guilt

[Chorus]
But I love you forever
Even if I can't have ya
When it is for the best
Know my heart wouldn't rest

I still love you forever
Even if we're not together
I'll make this all better
I'll leave and surrender


[Verse]
I make mistakes
That I can't erase
I never wanted you hurt
Should've known what I did was worst

And every night
I swallow my pride
To say I'm sorry for the fault that's all mine
I'm sorry I said sorry far too many times

[Chorus]
But I love you forever
Even if I can't have ya
When it is for the best
Know my heart wouldn't rest
I still love you forever
Even if we're not together
I'll make this all better
I'll leave and surrender

[Bridge]
It's not the way I wanted, it never was
And seeing u gives me in pain, knowing I was the cause
If there was something I could change, it'd be the past
But it's easier for you to walk away, then keep something that'll never last


[Chorus]
But I love you forever
Even if I can't have ya
When it is for the best
Know my heart wouldn't rest
I still love you forever
Even if we're not together
I'll make this all better
I'll leave and surrender
