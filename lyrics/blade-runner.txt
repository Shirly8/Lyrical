Blader Runner:
[Verse]
People come here
People tell me bunch of lies
Lament stories
But their movies don't seem right
It's the journey
It's the lost and it's the fight
It gets dark before the light
Na na na

People laughing
They have asked me questions why
I don't answer
Cuz they see all those times
Feel like quitting
Feel like doing what is right
Rather doing what I like

[Chorus]
Before the storm
All I knew you was my baby
And I thought I had it all
But then I lost it
Do I hold the scars or do I represent it
Do I let it go or do I let it fix me

[Verse]
People come here
People have their state of mind
They may love me
They may make me wanna cry
It's so funny
When they tell me all to stop
Only brings me to the top

[Chorus]
Before the storm
All I knew you was my baby
And I thought I had it all
But then I lost it
Do I hold the scars or do I represent it
Do I let it go or do I let it fix me?
 Or do I let it fix me?
Let it fix me…

[Chorus]
Before the storm
All I knew you was my baby (oooo)
And I thought I had it all
But then I lost it
Do I hold the scars or do I represent it
Do I let it go or do I let it fix me?
