[Verse]
I know it seems
Your heart is getting tighter
At least when you're not with her

I know it feels
The death of your desire
When she said you can't keep her

[Chorus]
There's a world out there
There's a girl who cares
There's the love so rare
If you take a dare

[Verse]
I know but it's love
You had it but she moved on
You blamed yourself not your fault
You know what's tough
To see you feel so empty
I'm the same when you're not with me

[Chorus]
There's a world out there
There's a girl who cares
There's the love so rare
If you take a dare

[Bridge]
You can do anything that you want at this hour
You can cry about it, put your head on my shoulder
I won't pretend, I'll be here, I won't bother
They said that feeling lost is a way to move further

Just know that I love you
Sometimes even more than a friend
Just know that
I'll help you
For now, I'll be here as your friend

[Chorus]
I'm the girl who cares
I'm the girl out there
I have stayed with you for 3 years
I've been the comfort to your worst tears

I'm the girl out there
I'm the girl who cares
We're the love so rare
I'll be ready if you take a dare.
