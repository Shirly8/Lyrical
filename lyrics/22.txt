Missing Girl:

[Verse]
I wonder what my face is like
On the cover of a billboard sign
With a poster beneath the traffic light
Will my captor be on my missing sign

And I'll wonder if I'll ever be
Be a free girl and will I ever see
My own mother… who has since believed
I've been murdered… buried under the forest trees

I'm the message for the community
That a child shall never roam streets
Pedophiles would up at 3
But he's in denial, that he's a wanted being

But this morning, when he left the shack
I Hear the sirens, I tap on the window glass
Then the loudness, maybe it'll be last
So I'm hopping, they'll find me in the back

And I'll wonder if they can hear me scream
But the thunder, makes it hard to see
Then the front door, opens up a beam
So I wonder if it was the police

And I wonder who will rescue me
But the captor thought I caused a scene
So he beat me.
Left me here to bleed
And I wonder how my face looks on TV

I should feel free
But I'm scared to leave
That place is lonely but
the world is scary

Should be relieved
You know what's funny
Always wondered how I look
But I don't think I look pretty

The mind is tricking me somehow
Like it's a dream that I'm finally out
If I pinch myself so hard
I might wake up in that house

I saw my missing poster
it wasn't even on the billboard
They just passed around some flyers
And I don't look like that picture
