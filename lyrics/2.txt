Volcano:

[Verse]
We start out slow motion
But then you want to push it
Baby you call it devotion
It would flare to explosion
But it's you who I'm missing
So when the smoke clears, I'll cave in
There's a volcano that's erupting
And the red hot lava's crashing

[Chorus]
Let's jump into the ocean
We'll escape all our emotions
Loving you was my destruction
Always be a situation
When I hear the ground go rumbling
And the red hot lava's crashing
So until our plates stop shifting
You will always keep us flowing

[Verse]
The first thing you say to me
Is how you like a man who's full of heat
How you like a man with fiery peak
When you push up
Then you push down
I will rise up
Make it loud
Higher
Form an earth's crush
Hotter than our's first love
Brighter than the red hot sun
Brighter than the red hot sun

I don't get your temperament
Your heart of gold is rotten to the core
Don't need a single force
But all I ask is a little more

[Chorus]
Let's jump into the ocean
We'll escape all our emotions
Loving you was my destruction
Always be a situation
When I hear the ground go rumbling
And the red hot lava's crashing
So until our plates stop shifting
You will always keep us flowing

[Bridge]
Let's escape
Get away
If we're stuck here, we'll be ashes like Pompeii

Let's escape
Get away
But no matter where we go, we'll end in flames

[Outro]
Into the ocean
We'll escape our emotions
Loving you was a destruction
Always be a situation
