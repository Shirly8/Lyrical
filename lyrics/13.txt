Cherry Blossom:

[Intro]
Upon a path so natural
Almost ethereal
Where petals dance and winds may blow
I'll wait in Yoshino

[Chorus]
Cherry Blossom
Smiling in the morning
I think you love me
I could tell, you're so spoken

Yeah Cherry blossom
Do I glow when it's pouring
You see right through me
I could tell, you're so open

By the way that you're looking
I could tell, you so spoken
I could tell, you're so open
By the way that you're looking

[Verse]
By the way that you're looking?
Do you find me this amusing?
I'm too pretty to be your muse then
Guess my moods ring's kinda working

With an aura this attracting
Better not be too distracting
But if beauty's not long-lasting
Will I still deserve ur love then?

[Chorus]
Cherry Blossom
Smiling in the morning
I think you love me
I could tell, you're so spoken

Yeah Cherry Blossom
Do I glow when it's pouring
You see right through me
I could you're so open

[Verse]
I am hoping
That by autumn
You'll still see me the same way I blossom
I may lose some
But with true love
You'll see the truth that lies in the wisdom
So when fate comes
Like Sakura
When the petal once high's at the bottom
I'll shed my grace on this trail just to show
That life is still celebrated til we're old

[Chorus]
Cherry Blossom
Smiling in the morning
I think you love me
I'm can tell you keep staring
 Cherry Blossom
When my skin get so wrinkly
You see right through me
Like you did when I was 20
