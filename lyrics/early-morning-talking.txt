Early Morning Talking:

[Chorus]
No, I don't need you in the morning
I gave you three warnings
I thought we've been through this
But you just keep coming

The sun shines like diamonds
It's bottling moments
And you will not ruin
I won't let you ruin


[Verse]
My mind is finally conscious
Its been a while since I feel a little patient
Every night I will fighting for a meaning
It was you, but still you I should be leaving

You're the taste a desire
And a gas to fire
But I'm the ignitor
It's relief for the hunger

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at the people around me
I don't know them but I'm not lonely
I don't need you to remind me
How it feels to be alive

[Chorus]
No, I don't need you in the morning
I gave you three warnings
I thought we've been through this
But you just keep coming

The sun shines like diamonds
It's bottling moments
And you will not ruin
I won't let you ruin

[Verse]
I don't know when you became concerning
Want you out of my apartment
Even if you're rewarding
My darling
My therapist told me about aggression
Moving away my obsession
But I fall to depression

[Pre-Verse]
Look at the people around me
I don't know them but I'm not lonely
I don't need you to remind me
How it feels to be alive

[Chorus]
No, I don't need you in the morning
I gave you three warnings
I thought we've been through this
But you just keep coming

The sun shines like diamonds
It's bottling moments
And you will not ruin
I won't let you ruin
