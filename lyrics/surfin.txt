Surfin:

[Verse]
It's the life that we dream about
It's those times when you have no doubts
The waves that go above
Your 2 feet still standing up

It's the taste of the lemonade
It's the sun shining on your face
If you've seen your life tomorrow
Would you change yourself today

[Pre-Chorus]
In my head
In my mind
I don't think I want to die

Not today
Not tonight
Maybe in another life

Maybe when those days get tired
Maybe when I can't inspire
Maybe then I could retire

[Chorus]
I'm surfing past the shallow water
Maybe I'll be searching
Something they can't offer

I'm surfing just along the surface
Maybe they'll be watching
No more second chances

[Verse]
Ten feet from the ocean ground
Too late, baby can't back down
The craze they talk about
But they don't know very much

It's the taste of the gatorade
It's the chance that you get each day
If you've seen your life tomorrow
Would you change your life today

[Pre-Chorus]
In my head
In my mind
I don't think I want to die

Not today
Not tonight
Maybe in another life

Maybe when those days get tired
Maybe when I can't inspire
Maybe then I could retire

[Chorus]
I'm surfing past the shallow water
Maybe I'll be searching
Something they can't offer

I'm surfing just along the surface
Maybe they'll be watching
No more second chances

[Bridge]
The feels build up adrenaline
I'm flowing through the waves again
The wind is blowing through my hair
I'll let it take me anywhere
Cause I'm

[Chorus]
I'm surfing past the shallow water
Maybe I'll be searching (Maybe I'll be searching)
Something they can't offer (Can't offer)

I'm surfing just along the surface
Maybe they'll be watching (Maybe they'll be watching)
No more second chances
