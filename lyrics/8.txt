Iris City:

[Verse]
Don't be afraid to fall
And the higher you go, don't call
A city built from the smog
It's been covered by the fog
Don't be scared it's small
It's been years since I've seen the rain fall
It's the city you can't unclog
And down there it's free for all

[Chorus]
I've spent years here
Wondering when its perfect
Seen an ocean full of lost tears
Wondering when they'll fix it
Seen they use us for their own gears
Wondering when it's our respect
And I picture my death coming near
One that they won't forget

[Verse]
It's the Iris city on a thread
And it's closing quicker, look ahead
We're the poor they cannot stand
So we live underneath the waste land
It's the iris city on a thread
But they got a roof over their head
And it's closing quicker, look ahead
Pretty soon we can't be fed

A city full of class
But soon they'll be one of us
Iris on its tip
What if it falls or slip

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to fall

Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid to fall

Don't be afraid to fall
When it all goes down, you'll call
When the power all goes out
We'll be blind it's a total black out
Don't be afraid to call
When you're stuck in a little wormhole
When you're scattered neath those dust
Raise your voice and call for us

[Chorus]
I've spent years here
Wondering when its perfect
Seen an ocean full of lost tears
Wondering when they'll fix it
Seen they use us for their own gears
Wondering when it's our respect
And I picture my death coming near
One that they won't forget

[Outro]
A city full of class
But soon they'll be one of us
Iris on its tip
What if it falls or slip
