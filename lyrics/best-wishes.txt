Best Wishes:

[Verse]
You two look so good
Just the way you should
Could the groom please take my hand
Just one dance

Dressing for myself
And nobody else
Feel like it's my chance to confess

[Pre-Chorus]
My hair is scented rose
Like the day when you propose
But sadly I said no
I'm sorry

With her you get along
Your vows do lifelong
And for that I'll leave at dawn

[Chorus]
I don't need a man
I don't need a chance
I'm happy for you're moment
To see you be excited
 I put my high heels on
I'm free when I'm alone
Congrats on your first wedding
Best wishes to your marriage
I really should go home

[Verse]
Don't mean to be rude
But I don't feel so good
I've come to flatter you
But maybe

I couldn't get it through
I saw the ring, she showed me too
The same gem I saw last June
When you were on your knees

[Pre-Chorus]
My dress is satin gold
Like the day when you propose
But sadly I said no
I'm sorry

It's time to let you go
Just like you when I went home
And for that I'll leave at dawn
So slowly

[Chorus]
I don't need a man
I don't need a chance
I'm happy for you're moment
To see you be excited
 I put my high heels on
I'm free when I'm alone
Congrats on your first wedding
Best wishes to your marriage
I really should go home
