Broken Heart:

[Verse]
Cuz ur the first in forever
Who played with my heart and
Who ripped it to pieces apart

You said that we'd be together
You gave me your words by
September you left and depart

And then for I months I remembered
I stood in the corner
My eyes looking down at the floor

Now my heart has been murdered
The pain starts to hurt more
I realized u did this before

[Pre-Chorus]
So every problem solves better when
I realize quicker that you
Were loser whose ego gets bigger
The more girls you conquer
The less they'll have on ya
So you'll never love me no more

[Chorus]
Cuz ur the first in forever
You played with my heart and
You ripped it to pieces apart

You said that we'd be together
You gave me your words by
September you left and depart

But then I took my scars
Covered up with concealer
Cuz now I'll know better
My head held high
And every broken heart is gone

[Verse]
You thought you were the man
But u were just a player
Play me like a violin, and throw me to the ringer
Gift me with a promise ring, now that's thrown in the fire
Talked shit about ur exes, like their ones that  you desire
A Red signs that I missed is, when you told me u don't see her

Liar liar, pants on fire
Lying bout ur body count
Lying till ur teeth falls out
Yeah I know who you are

And aw baby
You said what you said to get me
To forgive you

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the fact that you told me
That you'd love me forever
But left me the next day to go see a girl just  to say that youll love her forever

[Chorus]
Cuz ur the first in forever
You played with my heart and
You ripped it to pieces apart

You said that we'd be together
You gave me your words by
September you left and depart

But I took my scars
Covered up with concealer
Cuz now I'll know better
My head held high, and every broken heart is gone

Cuz for the first time forever
I wrote you a letter
And sent back ur sweater to u

I left my house to go see her
To tell her about all the
Wonders when I dated you

And then I showed my scars
There's no point in concealing
Cuz I'll know better
My head held high
And every broken heart is gone
