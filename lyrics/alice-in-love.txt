Tripping on Acid:

[Verse]
I
I find myself getting high
I'm in a situation
Intense hallucination

I
I just learned how to fly
Ive reached my destination
And I found my motivation

[Chorus]
When I'm tripping on acid
My body's numbness
Its heartbeat is crashing

Then I see a world in heaven
I wish it actually happen
Cuz real life's kinda heartless [heartless]

[Verse]
Ahhhhh
The purple blurs my eyes
I still use medication
To know I'm in the presence

Then I
I fall down from cloud 9
I feel like I am blinded
Blinded by my concious

[Chorus]
When I'm tripping on acid
My Body's in numbness
Its Heartbeat is crashing

Then I see a world of darkness
Then I cry from overwhelmness
Cuz real life's kinda heartless

[Bridge]
I Should've known that this life ain't mine
Maybe another life (another life)
I should've known that beauty is full lies
Concealed up by disguise

[Chorus]
When I'm tripping on acid
My bodys in numbest
It's heartbeat

Then I see the world in heaven
That's wiped out by darkness
When I am finally conscious
