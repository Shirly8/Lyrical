Alice in Love:
[Verse]
Dreams is a wonderful place to be
Maybe one day you'll come with me
And live up on fantasy
 You
You were never what's supposed to be
You just came unexpectedly
That's what makes you reality

[Chorus]
I never did much (I said it)
But you were the one (I meant it)
You healed me through love (I felt it)
And never be enough (I doubt it)

[Verse]
Love is thing that I don't believe
But I felt my heart skip a beat
So I will love you endlessly
 Oh time (time time)
It won't last til infinity (it won't last til infinity)
Moving faster than gravity
Every second you were with me

[Chorus]
I never did much (I said it)
But you were the one (I meant it)
You healed me through love (I felt it)
And never be enough (I doubt it)

[Bridge]
I don't need a genie
No wishes at all
I used to wish a big meaning
But the meanings been found
I put my head above clouds
Melancholy for sure
But when I surge into the ground
I was begging for me

[Chorus]
I never did much (I said it)
But you were the one (I meant it)
You healed me through love (I felt it)
And never be enough (I doubt it)

[Post-Chorus]
I don't need a genie
No wishes at all
I used to wish a big meaning
But the meanings been found
I put my head above clouds
Melancholy for sure
But when I surge into the ground
I was begging for me
