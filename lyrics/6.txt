Sunbeam:

[Verse]
You wanna know where I'm going
So I'll take control of this music

[Pre-Chorus]
My heart is skipping
skipping
Beating on rhythm
Here we go again
But I only get this moment
own it
won't let it waste it
I feel so content

[Chorus]
Cuz what if for the first time I won't promise I will change
Every moment, I've been told to keep my thoughts locked away
But I'm here now, I have spoken and I won't leave chose to stay
So from here on, they can't tell me that my purpose a mistake

No she didn't
No she didn't remember this moment
But she didn't say that you can forget it
No they hoped everything could change it
But it didn't so...

[Verse]
When someone tells you that's enough
You tell them to shut up
Sour words into lemonade

We only get this life once
We die from tryna grow up
So why can't we just go all the way

When the moon is up (I'll be on my own)
When the sun comes up (I'll be quite well-known)

So go
So go
But I know you won't

[Pre-Chorus]
I heard about these stories told so cold
I heard about this girl who became so bold
Cause one day when the world has turned to stone
It'd be me and you alone
It's a renaissance

[Verse]
No she didn't
No she didn't remember this moment
No she didn't say that you can forget it
No they hoped everything could change it
But it didn't so...
