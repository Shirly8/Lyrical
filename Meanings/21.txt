I am sitting in my electric chair awaiting my death, and I reminisce about a crime scene that I'm guilty of. I shot my boyfriend... but at least that's what they think. The truth is... he saw me with someone else, attacked him, but that person ended up shooting him. I took the blame to protect my love affair, and now I'll take this secret to the grave.
