Can you? Can you? Can you? I keep repeating it because I genuinely don't know if anyone can handle this. I have someone who takes so much pain from me and I can't wrap my head around it—when you're drowning in anxiety and everything's falling apart and someone just... stays. Doesn't run. Doesn't get tired of you. This song is me asking from a place of real fear: can you keep loving me when I'm this broken? It's the most vulnerable question I know how to ask.
