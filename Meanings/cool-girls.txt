I love the contrast in this one. Inspired by Gone Girl's "cool girl" monologue—that impossible standard of being effortlessly perfect. This song rejects all of that. It's about the weight of everyone's expectations of what an ideal woman should be and saying screw it. You want me to be chill, low-maintenance, always smiling? That's exhausting. Real is better than perfect. Messy is more honest than polished.
