I love the contrast in this one. It's about rejecting the fantasy of "cool girls" and embracing realness. I imagined someone saying they're not the perfect type from movies, but when the night falls and masks come off, they're the most authentic person in the room. It's confidence wrapped in vulnerability—being cool by being real.
