For the first time since I left you, I'm learning to live out my mornings without you. You had me convinced everything revolved around you—my thoughts, my day, my entire world. But now, finally, I'm present. I'm here. This song is about those early morning talks where time doesn't exist and everything feels possible, except now I'm having them with myself. Learning what it means to just exist without needing to be anything for anyone.
