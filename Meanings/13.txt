I really liked the cutsie instrumental Japanese vibe the sound gave off. Like a cherry blossom that blooms beautifully but fades quickly, I see that you admire my beauty but the real question is will you still love me as time goes on. This song explores the fear that love might be shallow—will they stay when the petals fall?
