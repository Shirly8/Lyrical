I loved the cutesy Japanese vibe this instrumental gave off. Like a cherry blossom—blooms beautifully but fades so quickly. You see my beauty now, but will you still love me when the petals fall? When I'm not new anymore? This song is about the fear that love might be shallow. That maybe they're only here for the pretty parts.
