This one's from the POV of a girl who's been abducted. The psychological aftermath of that. She's wondering how her parents are holding up, if her life back home still exists, how the media is covering her story—if they even are. Questioning if anyone's actually looking. There's this moment when she hears sirens and for a second, she thinks maybe this is it, maybe she's getting out. But that hope backfires. Sometimes hope is the cruelest thing.
