This one captures that feeling of riding a wave—literally and metaphorically. You're searching for something deeper than surface-level living. Taking risks because playing it safe feels like slowly dying. This song is about choosing to live fully even when you're terrified, because inspiring others to do the same matters more than staying comfortable.
