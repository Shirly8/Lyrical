This one's about finally finding your voice after being told to stay quiet for so long. I imagined someone standing in the sunbeam, refusing to shrink anymore. It's that moment when you decide your purpose isn't a mistake and you're done apologizing for taking up space. Pure defiance wrapped in confidence.
