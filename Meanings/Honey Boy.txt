Honey Boy

[Chorus]
Honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

Honey Boy
You think you cute, you such a tease
I see you lying through your teeth

Honey Boy
I’m way too fragile to be played off (played off)
And in denial to think I’m wrong (so wrong)

Honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

[Verse]
I’ve seen you through your highs and lows
You come and go
You hate the jokes
Yet you started most
You have no goals
But you hold onto one hope

But I don't know what it could've been
If we haven't changed
Our promises
Could be endless bliss
But your ignorance
Led us crash and burn that bridge

[Chorus]
So honey Boy
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

[Verse]
I wish upon a star
That your ass won't go too far
You'll mess up again
Can we play pretend
That you'll fall into my arms

I wish upon the moon
That one day you'll there soon
You'll get drunk again
Spilling secrets then
And loving me was one of them

[Chorus]
So honey boy
Quit your fucking act for me
Your only chance to come out clean
Come out clean
Come out clean

[Outro]
Theodore
Wear your heart upon your sleeves
Say what you need to say to me

I know: 

[Verse]
I know it seems 
Your heart is getting tighter
At least when you're not with her

I know it feels 
The death of your desire
When she said you can't keep her

[Chorus]
There's a world out there
There's a girl who cares
There's the love so rare
If you take a dare

[Verse]
I know but it's love
You had it but she moved on
You blamed yourself not your fault 
You know what's tough 
To see you feel so empty 
I'm the same when you're not with me

[Chorus]
There's a world out there
There's a girl who cares
There's the love so rare
If you take a dare

[Bridge]
You can do anything that you want at this hour
You can cry about it, put your head on my shoulder
I won't pretend, I'll be here, I won't bother
They said that feeling lost is a way to move further

Just know that I love you
Sometimes even more than a friend
Just know that 
I'll help you
For now, I'll be here as your friend

[Chorus]
I'm the girl who cares
I'm the girl out there
I have stayed with you for 3 years
I've been the comfort to your worst tears

I'm the girl out there
I'm the girl who cares
We're the love so rare
I'll be ready if you take a dare.
