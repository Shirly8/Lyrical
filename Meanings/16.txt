This song is a desperate plea for hope. I wanted to paint the picture of someone on the edge, walking a tightrope, asking if there's anyone out there who can make them feel like a beautiful soul worth saving. It's raw and vulnerable—the kind of asking that comes from a place of real fear and loneliness.
