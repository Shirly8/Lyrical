This title track is about unexpected love changing everything. I wanted to paint the picture of someone who lived in dreams until reality showed up in the form of a person who healed them. Time moves fast like gravity, but every second with them feels infinite. It's about choosing to love endlessly even when you know nothing lasts forever.
