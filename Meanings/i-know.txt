Three years of watching him love someone else. This one's about being the friend who's always been there—through the breakup, the heartache, all of it. The whole time feeling that same emptiness when he's not around. I'm trying to comfort him, telling him he'll find love again. But "There's a girl who cares"—it's me. I'm the girl. Always been the girl. That bridge is where I almost break. "Just know that I love you / Sometimes even more than a friend." By the end I'm not hiding. Three years of being there, three years of waiting. "I'll be ready if you take a dare"—ball's in his court now.
