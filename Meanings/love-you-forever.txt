This one's about the weight of knowing you pushed away someone who kept giving you chances. Living with that regret when you can't take it back. Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is let someone go, even when it destroys you. Even when you want to love them forever but know you'd only hurt them more by staying. It's choosing their peace over your heart.
