I love looking at the stars and feeling small in the best way possible. This song paints a picture of someone finding hope in the night sky, seeing their person in the constellations. It's about holding onto something beautiful when you're scared of the future—using the stars as a reminder that some things are infinite, even when life feels temporary.
