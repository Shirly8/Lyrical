This song paints a haunting picture of a missing girl who's been found but can't feel free. I wanted to explore that psychological aftermath—when escape should feel like relief but instead feels terrifying. The imagery of her face on missing posters that were barely circulated shows how easily people forget, how invisible she felt even in her own tragedy.
