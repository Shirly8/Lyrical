Who are you when everything you thought you knew gets ripped apart? This one's about carrying scars you didn't ask for while the world judges and judges and judges. It's about love that probably won't last and memories that hurt like hell but feel so real you can't let them go. Because if it hurts, it matters. That pain is proof it meant something. You're standing in the wreckage of who you used to be, trying to figure out if these scars define you or if you get to choose who you become next.
