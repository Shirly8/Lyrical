I imagined a dystopian city where the rich live above in the clouds and the poor survive in the wasteland below. Iris City is hanging by a thread—literally on the tip of an iris, ready to fall. This song is about someone who's spent years being invisible, and now they're picturing a dramatic end that finally makes people see them. Sometimes destruction feels like the only way to be noticed.
