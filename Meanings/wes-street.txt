This one's about friendship—the kind that saves you. That person waiting for you under the night sky, sipping slushies at 2am because they knew you'd need them. The one you can completely fall apart in front of without fear. Being someone's safe place is one of the most intimate things you can do. And sometimes, when you're both sitting there in the dark being each other's comfort, you wonder if it could turn into something more. But for now, this is enough.
