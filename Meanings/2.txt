This song is about a love that burns too hot, too fast—like a volcano ready to erupt. We start slow, but then it explodes into something destructive. I know this relationship is my destruction, but I keep coming back because the intensity is addictive. We're caught in a cycle of passion and chaos, and I can't escape.
