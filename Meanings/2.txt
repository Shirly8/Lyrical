This one's about love that burns too hot, too fast. Like a volcano ready to erupt. It starts slow and then explodes into something destructive. I know this is my destruction but I keep coming back anyway because the intensity is addictive. We're caught in this cycle of passion and chaos and I can't escape. Don't want to escape. Even when I know better.
