Torin! sent me this instrumental and I wanted something fun, messy, vibey. This song is that last dance when you already know it's over but you can't bring yourself to leave yet. I'm trying to figure out how I became the one walking away when they were the one who abandoned me first. How did that happen? It's confusing. It's messy. It's heartbreak wrapped in a beat that makes you want to dance through the pain. Sometimes the saddest songs sound the happiest.
