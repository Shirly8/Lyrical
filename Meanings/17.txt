I wanted to capture the isolation of being lonely in a cell—both literally and metaphorically. The imagery here is someone trapped by their own mind and circumstances, wondering if pulling the trigger is easier than holding on. It's dark, but it's real—the kind of loneliness that makes you question everything.
