This is my remix of Chase Atlantic's Ozone. In their version, they're the ones self-destructing. I flipped it—I'm watching someone I love destroy themselves and I'm being dragged down by it. The numbness of their addiction becomes mine too. I know what's happening. I see it clearly. But I still stay. Sometimes loving someone means standing in the wreckage with them even when you know you should walk away.
