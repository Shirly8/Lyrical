I wanted to capture the numbness of addiction and self-destruction. The ozone is a metaphor for everything I'm ruining—the atmosphere, the relationship, myself. It's about being clouded by smoke and white lines, sitting alone while knowing I'm never getting sober. It's honest about the cycle and the lack of answers for why we destroy what we love.
