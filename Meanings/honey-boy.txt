This one's about loving someone who won't be honest with you. Theodore runs hot and cold—shows up when he needs something, disappears when it gets real. The "honey boy" started sweet but turned bitter. We could've been something if he'd just stopped playing games. Instead I'm wishing on stars hoping maybe when he gets drunk he'll finally admit he loves me too. By the end I'm done being nice. "Quit your fucking act for me"—last chance to come clean or I'm gone. But that outro shows I'm still hoping he will.
