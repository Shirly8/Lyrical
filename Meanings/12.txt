This one's bittersweet. It's about sending someone off with genuine love and zero bitterness. Hoping they find everything they're looking for, even if it's not with you. That's the mature kind of heartbreak—when you care enough to want them happy from a distance. When you mean it when you say "I hope you're okay" even though it kills you.
